# weeble

Uses an existing anime database taken from
https://github.com/manami-project/anime-offline-database and adds/deletes some
data from public APIs.

## Guessing criteria

- Studio
- Year
- Director
- Episode count
- Popularity
- MAL / AniList score

## TO DO:

- Filter out stuff (<8min and <8 episodes) or <5min
- Filter out stuff by popularity in each year (<100 for shows, <10 for
  everything else) and global popularity
- Filter not SPECIAL or MUSIC
