# WEEBLE

Uses public APIs to get anime data based on various criteria and then uses that
data to make a Wordle- or Squirle-like game.

## Guessing criteria

- Studio
- Episode count
- Year
- Popularity
- Format
- Source

## TO-DO

### High-priority

- Add give up button and win/lose screen
- Make user unable to guess exact ranges of numbers
- Fix guess info badges/tooltips

### Low-priority

- Optimize search suggestions
- Fix on mobile

## Bugs

## Uncertainties

## Funny stuff

- A bug caused anime aliases to be prioritized over the English titles so
  searching often yielded the French/Italian/Spanish title first, which isn't
  inherently funny or anything but was definitely jarring in a funny way
